# Project Six: Building a Real-time Chat Application

For this project, we built a real-time chat application using WebSockets. The goal was to create a fast, responsive, and scalable chat solution that could be integrated into other applications.

## The Challenge

The main technical challenge was to handle real-time communication between multiple clients efficiently. We needed to ensure low latency and handle connection management gracefully.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js with the `ws` library for WebSocket server implementation.
- **Frontend:** Plain JavaScript with the browser's native WebSocket API.
- **Database:** Redis for storing user session information and message history.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Messaging:** Instantaneous message delivery between users.
- **User Presence:** See who is online in real-time.
- **Multiple Rooms:** Users can create and join different chat rooms.
- **Message History:** On joining a room, users can see the recent message history.

## Outcome

The resulting chat application is lightweight, performant, and reliable. It can handle a large number of concurrent connections with minimal latency. The simple API makes it easy to integrate into other projects.

This project was a great hands-on experience with WebSockets and real-time application architecture. It provided valuable insights into the challenges of building highly interactive and stateful web applications.
