# Project Four: Designing a Niche Social Networking App

This project involved designing and building a social networking application for a specific niche community: urban gardeners. The goal was to create a space for users to share tips, showcase their gardens, and connect with fellow enthusiasts.

## The Challenge

The main challenge was to design features that were tailored to the specific needs of the target audience. We wanted to go beyond a generic social media feed and provide real value to urban gardeners.

## User-Centered Features

- **Plant-Progress Journals:** Users can create journals for their plants, uploading photos and notes to track their growth.
- **Community Q&A:** A dedicated section for users to ask questions and get advice from experienced gardeners.
- **Seed Swap Marketplace:** A feature to facilitate the swapping of seeds and seedlings among local users.
- **Event Calendar:** A calendar for local gardening workshops and events.

## Design Philosophy

We opted for a clean, organic design aesthetic, using a color palette inspired by nature. The user interface was designed to be friendly and approachable, even for less tech-savvy users.

## Outcome

The app has been well-received by the target community, with a growing user base and high levels of engagement. The specialized features have been particularly popular, creating a vibrant and supportive online community. This project highlighted the importance of understanding the target audience and designing features that meet their unique needs.
